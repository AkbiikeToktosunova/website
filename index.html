            <p class="text"><i>Knitting is a way of life. It's never too late to learn how to crochet or use knitting needles. This does not require any supernatural devices. It is enough just to pick up the appropriate knitting needles and stock up on yarn. Knitting can be done at any time of the year, but it is especially pleasant to create knitted masterpieces in winter and autumn evenings. Knitting is a good way to relax and take a break from everyday activities.</i></p>

            <p class="text"><i>Drawing is silence for the mind and music for the eye.Drawing is one of the ways to express yourself, develop and increase self-esteem. The realities of modernity force people to focus primarily on what is useful, urgent and profitable. So the high rhythm of life drowns out the desire for creativity. But when there is time to rest, the desire to turn to art flares up in a person with a new force. It is important to remember that everyone can draw! This ability does not depend on age or natural gift.</i></p>

            <p class="text"><i>Pottery originated in ancient times. Numerous archaeological finds confirm that the first hand-sculpted clay products belong to the Neolithic era. The durable clay figurines and household items preserved to this day in the brightest colors tell about the history of the development of the ancient craft, which eventually developed so much that it became an art.Pottery is one of the oldest and most interesting crafts. But if previously only masters could do it, now work with clay is available to everyone. Anyone can create their own works, while receiving a positive energy charge.</i></p>
